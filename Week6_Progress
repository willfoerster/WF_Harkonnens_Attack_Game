Final Project Week 6 Summary

Test Plan and Results:
    The basis for the unit tests are to ensure the code is working as expected during development.
    So the unit tests will first be checking proper operation of each individual task. After I know
    all the tasks are individually working correctly, I will test the whether or not the 2 tasks
    share the proper data and still function properly. Then I will move to testing more tasks together
    until the whole system is working properly. 
    After all the unit tests pass at an acceptable rate, the functional rests will be used to confirm the expected
    results of the code visually. The functional tests will test if the slider and buttons work correctly in reference
    to motion of the platform and the HM.
    
    Unit Tests:
        Use ctests for all tests:
        
    1) [NotRun] test the velocity function for when the ball would be in free fall
    2) [NotRun] test the velocity function for when the ball bounces off the platform with a dead bounce and with a shield bounce
    3) [NotRun] test the velocity function for when the platform increases velocity to the left and the right
    4) [NotRun] test the position function for when the ball would be in free fall
    5) [NotRun] test the postion function for the platform moving at a constant velocity and when it accelerates from rest for both
    the left and right directions
    6) [NotRun] test the postion function for when the ball would hit a wall
    7) [NotRun] test the postion function for when the platform would hit the wall and either bounce or lose all velocity
    8) [NotRun] test the bounce function for when the ball is falling straight down and hits a stationary platform with and without 
    the shield boost
    9) [NotRun] test the bounce function for when the ball is falling straight down and hits a moving platform (moving both left aand right)
    10) [NotRun] test the led function for when the ball is free falling on the far right of the screen and the platform is stationary
    on the far left.
    11) [NotRun] test the led function with the ball free falling on the far right of the screen and the platform moving at a constant
    velocity to reach the the ball before it hits the grownd.
    
    Functional Tests:
      (Note: for tests 1-4 the HM falling object doesn't need to be on the screen)
    1) [NotRun] Using the slider, touch and hold the middle left channel and observe the platform slowly accelerate left.
    2) [NotRun] Using the slider, touch and hold the far left chennel and observe the platform accelerate left faster than test 1.
    3) [NotRun] Using the slider, touch and hold the middle right channel and observe the platform slowly accelerate right.
    4) [NotRun] Using the slider, touch and hold the far right chennel and observe the platform accelerate right faster than test 1.
    5) [NotRun] Having the HM fall in the center with the platform at rest directly below, observe the HM bounce straight up multiple times.
                Each bounce should be smaller than the last and the HM should eventiually fall through the platform.
    6) [NotRun] Using the same set up as step 5, press Button0 at the most 1 second before the HM hits the platform.
                Repeat this process unitl the HM bounces off the screen and does not come back down.
    7) [NotRun] With the HM falling in the center straight down, use the slider to hit the HM at an angle with pressing Button0
                from both the left and right sides. Observe the HM's trajectory bounce in the direction of motion of the platform.
    8) [NotRun] Repeat tests 5 and 6 but this time observe the left LED. As the HM accelerates or decelerate the led shoulw blink 
                faster or slower respectively.
    9) [NotRun] Having the platform start on the left side and the HM falling on the ride side of the screen, without moving the platform
                observe the right led blinking at an increasing rate as the HM falls to the ground.
    10) [NotRun]  When the HM starts falling, use Button1 to activate the lazer and observe the HM being destroyed.
    
    Test Summary:
       I have changed my unit test decription and am working on developing these tests. However, I think at this point it might be
       more important to finish the developement of the project without the unit tests since most my functions are working properly.
       I am planning on testing all of my functional tests on either 4/23 or 4/24.
    
Progress of Project week 6:
    At the end of week 6, the physics and LCD tasks are almost completed. The goal for this weekend is to debug using the functional tests
    and finsh the LED task which will be the last part of the project.
Summary of effort:
    My current progress puts the project at 80% done. The percentage is still behind expectation because at this point the project should 
    be fully finished with minor debugging and tweaking left. To make up for this, I will be spending at least 15 hours this weekend to 
    get the full project ready by Monday so I can make minor adjustments on monday and demo on Tuesday.
In Scope Work Items:
    1) Platform Data Sructure-Complete
    2) HM Data Structure-complete
    3) Button Data Structure-complete
    4) Semaphores -completed
    5) Mutexes -completed
    6) Button Task -complete
    7) Platform Task -conpleted
    8) Physics Task -in progress
    9) LCD Task -in progress
    10) LED Task -not started
Risk: risk level (1-10) * Probability it will happen
    Personal Struggles: 8 * 60 = 480 (mitigated)
    Board Malfunction: 4 * 100 = 400 (accepted)
    Includes Problems: 8 * 80 = 160 (resolved)
    Other Classes Interference: 7 * 60 (mitigated)
      No changes since week 4.
