Final Project Summary

Test Plan and Results:
    The basis for the unit tests are to ensure the code is working as expected during development.
    So the unit tests will first be checking proper operation of each individual task. After I know
    all the tasks are individually working correctly, I will test the whether or not the 2 tasks
    share the proper data and still function properly. Then I will move to testing more tasks together
    until the whole system is working properly. 
    After all the unit tests pass at an acceptable rate, the functional rests will be used to confirm the expected
    results of the code visually. The functional tests will test if the slider and buttons work correctly in reference
    to motion of the platform and the HM.
    
    Unit Tests:
        Use ctests for all tests:
        
    1) [NotRun] test the velocity function for when the ball would be in free fall
    2) [NotRun] test the velocity function for when the ball bounces off the platform with a dead bounce and with a shield bounce
    3) [NotRun] test the velocity function for when the platform increases velocity to the left and the right
    4) [NotRun] test the position function for when the ball would be in free fall
    5) [NotRun] test the postion function for the platform moving at a constant velocity and when it accelerates from rest for both
    the left and right directions
    6) [NotRun] test the postion function for when the ball would hit a wall
    7) [NotRun] test the postion function for when the platform would hit the wall and either bounce or lose all velocity
    8) [NotRun] test the bounce function for when the ball is falling straight down and hits a stationary platform with and without 
    the shield boost
    9) [NotRun] test the bounce function for when the ball is falling straight down and hits a moving platform (moving both left aand right)
    10) [NotRun] test the led function for when the ball is free falling on the far right of the screen and the platform is stationary
    on the far left.
    11) [NotRun] test the led function with the ball free falling on the far right of the screen and the platform moving at a constant
    velocity to reach the the ball before it hits the grownd.
    
    Functional Tests:
      (Note: for tests 1-4 the HM falling object doesn't need to be on the screen)
    1) [Run: 66% Pass] Using the slider, touch and hold the middle left channel and observe the platform slowly accelerate left.
    2) [Run: 66% Pass] Using the slider, touch and hold the far left chennel and observe the platform accelerate left faster than test 1.
    3) [Run: 66% Pass] Using the slider, touch and hold the middle right channel and observe the platform slowly accelerate right.
    4) [Run: 66% Pass] Using the slider, touch and hold the far right chennel and observe the platform accelerate right faster than test 1.
    5) [Run: 100% Pass] Having the HM fall in the center with the platform at rest directly below, observe the HM bounce straight up multiple times.
                Each bounce should be smaller than the last and the HM should eventiually fall through the platform.
    6) [Run: 100% Pass] Using the same set up as step 5, press Button0 at the most .5 seconds before the HM hits the platform.
                Repeat this process unitl the HM bounces off the screen and does not come back down.
    7) [Run: 100% Pass] With the HM falling in the center straight down, use the slider to hit the HM at an angle with pressing Button0
                from both the left and right sides. Observe the HM's trajectory bounce in the direction of motion of the platform.
    8) [Run: 100% Pass] Repeat tests 5 and 6 but this time observe the right LED. As the HM  kenetic energy increase or decreases the led should blink 
                faster or slower respectively.
    9) [Run: 100% Pass] As you play the game observe the left LED increase in pwm frequency propartional to the distance between the platform 
                and the ball
    10) [Run: 100% Pass]  When the HM starts falling, use Button1 to activate the lazer and observe the HM being destroyed.
    
    Test Summary:
       Due to complications during the development of the unit tests and the timeline of the project, I was not able to develope my unit tests. 
       This set me back a little because I was not able to tests my physics calculations prior to the developemnt of the physics task. So in order
       to test the cutting points described in the unit test portion, I had to test through observation of the code and variable values. On the 
       other hand, I was able to get the project fully functional and pass almost all of the functional tests at 100% pass/fail rate. However,
       the first four functional tests only passed at a 66% pass/fail rate because the slider will randomly get stuck in a left or right possition
       increasing the velocity of the platform to maximum velocity. I attempted to fix this issue through changing the task priority and changing
       frequency of the task associated with the slider, but these attempts did not give any better results.
    
    Project Summary:
        As of demo day, my project is fully function and playable with accouple bugs. The game will freeze or the slider will get stuck in a certain 
        direction, however, this does not effect play too much because you can reset the game if these issues happen to resolve them. The project has
        fulfilled all the project specifications to the best of my ability. Some of the things that are different from the project specifications are 
        the LED1 pwm being related to the distance between the platform and the HM instead of the percent of max forced required for the platform 
        to reach the HM before it hits the ground.
